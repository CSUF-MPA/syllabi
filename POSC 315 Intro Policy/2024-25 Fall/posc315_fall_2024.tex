\section*{Catalog Description}

	Federal domestic policymaking. Structure, functions, and relationships among American national institutions, including executive, legislative and judicial branches, media, political parties, and pressure groups.

\section*{Course Description}

	In this course, students will explore and engage in thoughtful discussions on the processes and key players in creating public policy in the United States. The curriculum focuses on the structure, functions, and relationships among American national institutions, including the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of government, the media, political parties, and interest groups. We will examine the various official and unofficial influences on the policy process and the limitations imposed by institutional and structural factors.

	\noindent This course delves into the historical and constitutional development of the policy process, as well as the distinct characteristics of public policy within a federal system. By understanding policy-making in the context of a constitutional republic and a federalized governance system, students will gain a deeper appreciation for the complexities and uncertainties surrounding agenda setting, policy making, policy implementation, and policy evaluation in the American political system.

\section*{Student Learning Objectives}

By the end of this course, students will be able to

\begin{enumerate}
	\item discuss and explain the key features of the public policy-making process in the United States;
	\item recognize and describe the distinct stages of the public policy process;
	\item describe the various internal and external actors that influence public policy, their interactions, and their impact on the policy process;
	\item articulate the historical and contemporary structures and institutions that facilitate, expand, or constrain the public policy process;
	\item differentiate and describe the various theories that attempt to explain the drivers and influences leading to public policy change or maintaining the status quo; and
	\item apply their knowledge of the policy process to analyze specific policy domains impacted by multiple policy actors and diverse elements of the policy process within the context of public policy-making in the United States.
\end{enumerate}
